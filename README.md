This package implements file-based [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/) cache.

## Installation

The package could be installed with composer:

```
composer install yiisoft/cache-file
```

## Configuration

When creating an instance of `\Yiisoft\Cache\File\FileCache`, you must specify
the path to the base directory in which the cache files will be stored:

```php
$cache = new \Yiisoft\Cache\File\FileCache('/path/to/directory');
```

Change the suffix of the cache files:

```php
$cache = $cache->withFileSuffix('.txt'); // default is '.bin'
```

Change the permission to be set for newly created cache files:

```php
$cache = $cache->withFileMode(0644); // default is null
```

This value will be used by PHP `chmod()` function. No umask will be applied.
If not set, the permission will be determined by the current environment.

Change the permission to be set for newly created directories:

```php
$cache = $cache->withDirectoryMode(0777); // default is 0775
```

This value will be used by PHP `chmod()` function. No umask will be applied. Defaults to 0775,
meaning the directory is read-writable by an owner and group, but read-only for other users.

Change the level of sub-directories to store cache files:

```php
$cache = $cache->withDirectoryLevel(3); // default is 1
```

If the system has huge number of cache files (e.g. one million), you may use a bigger
value (usually no bigger than 3). Using sub-directories is mainly to ensure the file
system is not over burdened with a single directory having too many files.

Change the probability of performing garbage collection when storing a piece of data in the cache:

```php
$cache = $cache->withGcProbability(1000); // default is 10
```

The probability (parts per million) that garbage collection (GC) should be performed when
storing a piece of data in the cache. Defaults to 10, meaning 0.001% chance. This number
should be between 0 and 1000000. A value 0 means no GC will be performed at all.

## General usage

The package does not contain any additional functionality for interacting with the cache,
except those defined in the [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/) interface.

```php
$cache = new \Yiisoft\Cache\File\FileCache('/path/to/directory');
$parameters = ['user_id' => 42];
$key = 'demo';

// try retrieving $data from cache
$data = $cache->get($key);

if ($data === null) {
    // $data is not found in cache, calculate it from scratch
    $data = calculateData($parameters);
    
    // store $data in cache for an hour so that it can be retrieved next time
    $cache->set($key, $data, 3600);
}

// $data is available here
```

In order to delete value you can use:

```php
$cache->delete($key);
// Or all cache
$cache->clear();
```

To work with values in a more efficient manner, batch operations should be used:

- `getMultiple()`
- `setMultiple()`
- `deleteMultiple()`

This package can be used as a cache handler for the [Yii Caching Library](https://github.com/yiisoft/cache).
